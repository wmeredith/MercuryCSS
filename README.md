## Who is this for?
This is for someone looking for a minimal stylesheet focused on typography and speed. Either as a starting point for something grander, or as an end point for something highly focused.

## What is it?
It's a stylesheet. Grab the SCSS from /SCSS or the compiled CSS from /dist.

## Why?
I've been designing tech stuff for over ten years now. I've needed something like more times than I count. So I'm maintaining it here. This is as much for personal use as public. I've also used countless boilerplates, starters, frameworks myself.
